1.  What to do if you get an, "Overwriting previous address contents." error or warning message while compiling the
    PicBasic Pro V2.60 project file:

    This error/warning is returned by PBP whenever the configuration fuses in the default inlude file for your         chosen microcontroller are being overwritten.

    The simplist fix is to drop the following modified include file (16F877A.INC) into your C:\Program Files\PBP\     directory.  

	This file comments out the following two lines for the PIC16F877A device:

		;device  pic16F877A, xt_osc, wdt_on, lvp_off, protect_off

		;__config _XT_OSC & _WDT_ON & _LVP_OFF & _CP_OFF

2.  Make sure ReEnterPBP.bas, Elapsed_INT.bas, DT_INTS-14.bas and PIC16F877A.pbp are in the same project folder as      the reflowXX.pbp (XX is the revision number) file.

3.  There is a hex file in the project folder for those that do not want to compile the project.
